ezmongo
==============

Easy and light weight interface wrapping the native node.js MongoDB driver, the [mongodb](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native) module.

Simple wrapper to use basic insert/find/modify/delete functions. Ability to access native collection and database objects for more advanced operations.

By default uses [shortId](https://github.com/dylang/shortid) so that new objects have short strings as _ids instead of ObjectIDs.
Also by default has protections in place to prevent accidentally clobbering an object on update.
Optional ability to require the fields to retrieve for find() operations to be specified (good for performance!) and many other features as well!

Provides the following functions:

* [findOne](#findOne)
* [findMultiple](#findMultiple)
* [updateOne](#updateOne)
* [updateMultiple](#updateMultiple)
* [upsertOne](#upsertOne)
* [upsertMultiple](#upsertMultiple)
* [removeOne](#removeOne)
* [removeMultiple](#removeMultiple)
* [insert](#insert)
* [count](#count)

As well as access to the native collection and database objects:

* [collection](#collection)
* [db](#db)

Ability to enable/disable (good for maintenance mode)

* [disable](#disable)
* [enable](#enable)


Installation
============

    npm install ezmongo

API
=============

## Constructor

* **safe_id** - if true, an error will be thrown if a $set or $unset operation attempts to modify the _id field *(default: true)*
* **safeModify** - if true, an error will be thrown if any of the root level keys of the modification don't start with '$' *(default: true)*
* **requireFields** - if true, an error will be thrown if a find operation is done without the fields to retrieve being specified *(default: false)*

    // below will query as soon as DB is connected
    ezMongo.findOne('myCollection', function(err, doc) {
        console.log('look what I found!',doc);
    });
```

## findOne

* *callback* - function called after the find. First argument is any error that was encountered. Second argument is the document if found, otherwise null.

```javascript
    ezMongo.findOne('myCollection', {num: {$gte: 2}}, ['field1','field2.subfield'], [['rank','asc']], function(err, doc) {

    });
```

Further Development
============
The features are not yet inclusive. The [collection](#collection) and [db](#db) commands allow getting around this, however going forward additional features (e.g. count()) may be added as the needs arise.

Testing
============
Testing uses nodeunit, which you can install globally

     npm install -g nodeunit

To run the tests, execute:

     nodeunit test/

This module is not yet fully covered by tests. Particularly the various constructor options. While uses in production also help tease out errors, expanded test coverage is a goal.

Version 0.0.6 has been tested and works with node version 0.12.4 and MongoDB 3.0.3. If you use older versions you may need an older version of ezmongo.

Projects using EzMongo
============
EzMongo was originally created for Node Knockout 2011 winner for Most Fun, [Doodle Or Die](http://doodleordie.com) and is still used today. Millions of hilarious doodles have been saved and accessed using EzMongo.
EzMongo is also used for projects by the [Video Blocks](http://videoblocks.com) team. Unlimited downloads stock video, after effects templates, and more for one flat price.
